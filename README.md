I’m a computer science student at Stevens Institute of Technology, minoring in Quantitative Finance, with a strong interest in research and machine learning. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and finance, applying computational and analytical skills to solve complex problems. I’m passionate about learning, innovating, and collaborating on projects that combine technical insight with financial understanding.
