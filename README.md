Hi! I'm Aditi.
I’m a Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology, minoring in Quantitative Finance, with a passion for research, machine learning, and exploring the intersection of technology and finance. I enjoy applying computational and analytical skills to solve complex problems, whether through software development, data analysis, or research projects. I’m constantly learning, experimenting with new technologies, and looking for ways to combine technical knowledge with financial insight to create meaningful solutions.

I am currently working on:
- Building interactive web applications to improve productivity and usability.
- Exploring machine learning and data analysis projects in Python.
- Expanding knowledge in quantitative finance and fintech applications.
